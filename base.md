# 864 System
The 864 is a simplified tabletop role-playing system uses the d8, d6, and d4 dice for its mechanics. It uses dice elimination and simple modifiers to set up roll targets and determine success.

## Defining entities
An entity is defined as a player character, non-player character, monster, creature, or any other sentient or semi-sentient inhabitant of the adventure world.

### Stats
Entities will have one or more stats that will be displayed as bonuses or penalties. Considering that on a scale from 3 to 18 every increase or decrease represents 6.25%, it is suggested that abilities run the gamut from -5 to +5. Abilities can be set up as physical descriptions (strength, agility, intellect) and skill-like (forgery, metalsmith, handguns).

## Base mechanics
All attempts at performing an action will have one of three ratings: easy, medium, and hard. These ratings determine which dice will be used by whoever is performing the action.

* Easy: d8 + d6 + d4
* Medium: d8 + d6
* Hard: d8

Any ability or skill modifiers will be added to these rolls.
