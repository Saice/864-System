# 864 System
The 864 is a simplified tabletop role-playing system uses the d8, d6, and d4 dice for its mechanics. It uses dice elimination and simple modifiers to set up roll targets and determine success.

## Defining entities
An entity is defined as a player character, non-player character, monster, creature, or any other sentient or semi-sentient inhabitant of the adventure world.

### Abilities
Abilities define global characteristics of any sentient or semi-sentient entity. These are defined by how many dice are rolled when using them, and have three levels:

* High: d8 + d6 + d4
* Average: d8 + d6
* Low: d8

These are some possible stats for player characters:

#### Strength
Measures raw physical strength and power. Melee attacks use this stat as their base.

#### Agility
Measures physical nimbleness.

#### Dexterity
Measures hand-to-eye coordination and precise handiwork. Use this ability as the base for missile attacks.

#### Endurance
Measures toughness and resistance to damage.

#### Acumen
Measures the ability for reasoning and understanding.

#### Tenacity
Measures the entity's mental strength and resilience.

#### Awareness
Determines how "in-tune" the entity is to their surroundings.

### Additional abilities

#### Physical resistance
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. This is defined as follows, based on the Endurance ability:

* High: 6
* Average: 4
* Low: 2

#### Mental resistance
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. This is defined as follows, based on the Tenacity ability:

* High: 6
* Average: 4
* Low: 2

#### Attack target
Determines how easy or difficult it is to hit the character with a physical attack. To determine this stat, consult the Agility and Awareness scores. Add them up using the following reference values:

* High: +4
* Average: 0
* Low: -4

Take 8 and add the values of both abilities. The result is the base number someone needs to roll (or higher) to hit the entity with a physical attack. For example, a player character with high agility and average awareness would have 4 + 0 + 8 = 12 or more to be hit.

## Base mechanics
All attempts at performing an action will be performed against a target number from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the more difficult the action is.
